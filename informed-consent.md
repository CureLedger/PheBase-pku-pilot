# PheBase Genetic Metabolic Data Registry  
## Informed Consent  

The PheBase ("PhB") genetic metabolic data registry collects information from existing biobanks and labs to provide researchers access to the reliable data they need to better understand and treat this spectrum of disorders.  

A rare disease registry collects and stores medical and other information from individuals with the same disease. A biobank is a place that stores tissue, blood, or other samples. Registries and biobanks often work together to share information.  

Metabolic patients have sampled and tracked for years and have an opportunity to harness that data so that researchers have better information to understand the disorders and develop new treatments.  

The rarity and variety of genetic metabolic mutations have made it hard to address with traditional clinical research methods.  

Today's technologies give us the opportunity to put the power of data to work finding breakthroughs.

## How does the registry work?  

De-identified information regarding your genetic metabolic treatment history will be included in a secure database that will be used for medical research and experimental clinical trials. The purpose of the registry is to better understand rare diseases and to develop new treatments. The registry also addresses other critical needs like the turnaround of testing results and the distribution of treatments.  

Scientists will access the HGM registry in order to find accurate information to understand how genetic metabolic disorders affect people. In addition, scientists who want to start studies, such as testing new treatments, will need access to the HGM registry to locate people who may be eligible to participate in studies.  

There is no cost to you to participate in the registry.

- I understand that by agreeing to participate, I will be contacted by the registry to update or correct my health information regularly.  
- I am willing to provide my de-identified medical information to be used for clinical trials and other medical studies related to my disease.  
- I understand that my de-identified information can be used for any approved research study, including diseases that are not associated with my disease.  
- I understand that my de-identified information will be shared with other databases such as the Global Rare Disease Patient Registry and Data Repository (GRDR) and the National Organization for Rare Diseases (NORD).  
- I understand that I may not personally benefit from participating in the registry or from the use of my de-identified medical information in any research study.  
- I understand that I can withdraw from the registry at any time and remove my information. I also understand that any information given previously, and already assigned to a specific study, cannot be removed.  
- I understand the content of this form. I was given the background information, I had enough time to ask questions, all my questions were answered, and I had enough time to decide that I want to participate in this registry. I will be given a copy of this consent.
